The function that enables you to play Go is the go(n,tb,tp).
Where:
n is the number of columns and lines;
tb is a tuple of the intersections of the white pebles;
tp tb is a tuple of the intersections of the black pebles.

If you want to start a game from the begining type go(9,(),()) for a 9x9 board.
If you want start a game with pebles you must use the cria_intersecao(str for column, int for line).
